## Progress
- Make your own Neural network in python [(url)](https://www.educative.io/courses/make-your-own-neural-network-in-python): 100%
- Matplolib for python [(url)](https://www.educative.io/courses/matplotlib-for-python-visually-represent-data-with-plots): 100%
- Machine Learning with NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn and More [(url)](https://www.educative.io/courses/machine-learning-numpy-pandas-scikit-learn): 54%

## Structure
Each folder correspond to a course from Educative. In each folder you can find a `note.md` with all my notes and summary of the class. Furthermore, you can find some of my code (*some inspired from given example on Educative*) related to each classes.

## Summary
- [Neural Network](Make_your_neural_network/Note.md)
- [Matplotlib introduction](Matplotlib_for_Python/note.md)
- [Machine learning](Machine_learning/note.md)
