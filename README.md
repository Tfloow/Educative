Here, you can find my journey through various courses proposed by [Educative](https://www.educative.io). 

## Progress
- Make your own Neural network in python [(url)](https://www.educative.io/courses/make-your-own-neural-network-in-python): 100%
- Matplolib for python [(url)](https://www.educative.io/courses/matplotlib-for-python-visually-represent-data-with-plots): 18%

## Structure
Each folder correspond to a course from Educative. In each folder you can find a `note.md` with all my notes and summary of the class. Furthermore, you can find some of my code (*some inspired from given example on Educative*) related to each classes.

## Credit
Code written by Me. Each classes belong to their rightful writer that can be found on Educative's website.
