## Structure
Each folder correspond to a course from Educative. In each folder you can find a `note.md` with all my notes and summary of the class. Furthermore, you can find some of my code (*some inspired from given example on Educative*) related to each classes.

## Summary
- [Neural Network](Make_your_neural_network/Note.md)
- [Matplotlib introduction](Matplotlib_for_Python/note.md)
- [Machine learning](Machine_learning/note.md)
